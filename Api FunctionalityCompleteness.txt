Here are some evaluation parameters for API functionality completeness:


1.API code generation: The ability to generate code from the API is a key criterion for evaluating API automation tools

2.Request-response model and endpoint: This criterion evaluates how well the API handles requests and responses, and how easy it is to work with the API endpoints

3.Impact analysis: This criterion evaluates the impact of the API on the business and how well it aligns with the digital business goals

4.Programming languages: This criterion evaluates the programming languages that the API supports and how well it integrates with other programming languages

5.License type / open source: This criterion evaluates the license type of the API and whether it is open source or not

6.User control and freedom: This criterion evaluates how much control the user has over the API and how easy it is to use

7.Consistency and standards: This criterion evaluates how consistent the API is and whether it adheres to industry standards

8.Error handling: This criterion evaluates how well the API handles errors and how easy it is to debug

9.Visibility of system status: This criterion evaluates how well the API communicates the system status to the user

10.Evaluation metrics: This criterion evaluates the metrics used to evaluate the API, such as response time, throughput, and error rat
