Coding standards are crucial for creating readable and maintainable code. Readable code is code that clearly communicates its intent to the reader

1. It is important to write code that is easy for other developers to read, as messy code can cause a variety of issues

2.Good software development organizations want their programmers to maintain a well-defined and standard style of coding called coding standards

3. A coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different engineers, improving readability and maintainability of the code

4.On the other hand, coding guidelines give some general suggestions regarding the coding style that should be followed for the betterment of understandability and readability of the code

5. If coding guidelines are maintained properly, then the software code increases readability and understandability, thus reducing the complexity of the code

6.To ensure readability, there are some general rules that can be followed. Formatting is king, and code should be formatted consistently

7.Dead code should be removed, and the fewer comments, the better

8. Names should be clear and descriptive, and creativity should not be prioritized over clarity

9. Breaking up large blocks of code into smaller, more manageable pieces can also improve readability

Ultimately, readable code is important because it makes refactoring, extending, and modifying parts of the system straight forward

 It is the foundation of a solid codebase, where engineers are confident and quick to make changes

In order to produce readable code, it is advisable to perform code reviews, write tests and use them as documentation, choose meaningful names, and follow coding standards and guidelines
